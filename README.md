# ♻️ Smart Waste Segregation in Water Bodies using YOLO

An AI-based system to detect and classify plastic waste in water bodies using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. This project is designed to support environmental sustainability by identifying plastic waste in real-time from images, videos, or live camera feeds.

---

## 📌 Objective

To automate the segregation of waste (especially plastic) in water bodies using computer vision techniques, contributing to the reduction of plastic pollution and aiding clean-up efforts.
